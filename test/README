Unit Tests
==========

Unit testing is very important. Verifying that a class or function works in isolation makes it much easier to integrate into existing code.

NOTE: Currently, all unit test programs are built into build/test/, so don't worry if you can't see your program in test/ after building Bakge. This will be fixed at a later time :)

If you make a contribution which requires or required some testing, you should add it to the CMake build. It's actually quite easy, just open the test/CMakeLists.txt file, and search for the line that says:

set(TESTS
  ...
  ...
)

Insert your file into the list (no extension necessary). If all is well you should see your test compile the next time you run a fresh CMake build.
